# angry_birds_game
Further practising my projectile modelling in code, and handling objects colliding. Created a simple game inspired by angry birds with a couple levels where users can throw a projectile at some targets. To earn points ensure the projectile hits the targets and ensure the targets hit the ground to complete the level.
